# Protected flows — change log

Campaign, UGC and Invite-to-campaign are **locked** (Ravi, session 28: all three tested and working
on the deployed build; launch is close). See `scripts/protectedFlows.mjs` and docs/code/ARCHITECTURE.md rule 60.

- Logic files: frozen by content hash.
- Screen files of these flows: design may change; the server calls they make may not.

Only Ravi can approve a change. After he approves, run:
`npm run protect:update -- --reason "what Ravi approved"` — every run is logged below.

## Log

- 2026-09-29 — **Baseline** (session 28, v220): Ravi tested Campaign, UGC and Invite-to-campaign on v219 and all work. v220 adds only the session-28 fixes (brand KYC gate, per-user drafts, live refresh). 35 logic files + 4 screen groups (chat, ugc, campaign, invite) locked.

- 2026-09-28T22:09:00.966Z — Session 28: signature records (agreement_signatures) — Ravi approved in chat: 'ye toh abhi hi implement krege'. Sign routes save text/version/OTP email/IP; screens send their text; lock list +3 files.
  - logic files changed: backend/deals_routes.ts, backend/deals_chat_routes.ts, backend/signTokens.ts, backend/agreementRecord.ts, backend/admin_agreements_routes.ts, src/lib/agreementCapture.js, backend/ugc_routes.ts, src/components/chat/mobile/useChatThreadMobile.js
  - screen call groups changed: none

- 2026-09-29T12:42:46.179Z — Session 30, Ravi (chat): 'inka backend bhi bana do or inka ui bhi bana do' — adds campaign pause/close/matching-creators backend (new file backend/campaignManage.ts, apply guard in front of the locked apply route) and the mobile campaign list/detail screens. No existing locked file changed its logic; the locked applicants and campaigns pages only render the new mobile screens.
  - logic files changed: none
  - screen call groups changed: none

- 2026-09-29T12:42:55.814Z — Session 30, Ravi: adds backend/campaignManage.ts and the two mobile campaign screens to the lock (they were built on Ravi's OK in chat).

  - screen call groups changed: campaign

- 2026-09-29T20:23:14.560Z — Session 30, Ravi (chat): 'naya agreement UGC aur campaign chat mein attach karo; campaign ka UI aur backend update ho; terms tick karein tabhi OTP jaaye; calls aur logic na toote'.

  - logic files changed: src/lib/agreementCapture.js, src/lib/agreementTerms.js
  - screen call groups changed: chat

- 2026-10-06T05:36:33.874Z — Session 31, Ravi (SESSION_30_SUMMARY item 4: 'UGC lock — navigation only, Ravi OK to update the lock'; confirmed 'Continue' in chat): after paying for a UGC brief the brand lands on My Briefs, not an empty Create brief form. briefPaymentRetry.js: markBriefPosted / takeRecentBriefPost + replace-navigation after checkout closes.

  - logic files changed: src/lib/briefPaymentRetry.js
  - screen call groups changed: none

- 2026-10-06T06:16:11.350Z — Session 31 mobile chat audit, Ravi (chat): 'ye sab 5 ki 5 theek kr do ... desktop vale mai changes mat krna, sirf mobile'. useChatThreadMobile.js: creator can decline a live-link correction (same endpoints as desktop SystemMessage), no invented 15000 escrow amount, /pay follow-up like desktop, correct UGC collab approve text, link-rejection local state = server state. Desktop files unchanged; no backend change.
  - logic files changed: src/components/chat/mobile/useChatThreadMobile.js
  - screen call groups changed: none

- 2026-10-06 — Session 34, Ravi (chat, session 33): 'invite popup ke liye ok hai'.

- 2026-10-07T08:05:22.913Z — Session 34. Ravi in chat (7 Oct 2026), replying to 'Escrow shabd hata ke secure payment hold likh doon? Isme kuch locked files bhi badlengi': 'HN YE ESCROW WORD HATA KR KAAM SHURU KR SAKTE HO ISKI JAGAHA SECURE PAYMENT HOLD KR DO'. Text-only change in 9 locked files (user-visible strings: escrow -> secure payment hold; code skeleton unchanged, verified line by line; message-matching strings like includes('escrow payment released') left as they were). Plus Ravi 'hn toh isko PAN hi krdo' (KYC = PAN + bank/UPI): backend/creators_routes.ts KYC submit no longer stores Aadhaar number / images.
  - logic files changed: backend/campaigns_routes.ts, backend/campaign_lifecycle.ts, backend/deals_chat_routes.ts, backend/payment_routes.ts, src/lib/agreementTerms.js, backend/creators_routes.ts, src/components/chat/orderTicket.js, src/components/chat/mobile/chatStageMap.js, src/components/chat/mobile/useChatThreadMobile.js, src/lib/razorpay.js
  - screen call groups changed: none

- 2026-10-07T08:07:15.858Z — Session 34, same approval as the entry above (Ravi: 'HN YE ESCROW WORD HATA KR KAAM SHURU KR SAKTE HO ISKI JAGAHA SECURE PAYMENT HOLD KR DO'). Second text-only pass: src/lib/agreementTerms.js visible agreement wording escrow -> secure payment hold; code skeleton unchanged.
  - logic files changed: src/lib/agreementTerms.js
  - screen call groups changed: none

- 2026-10-07T12:31:26.401Z — Session 35.

Text-only: 7 leftover user-visible strings escrow -> secure payment hold (agreementTerms.js hint, razorpay.js 3 test-mode toasts, useChatThreadMobile.js 2 toasts + 1 confirm). Code skeleton unchanged, verified with diff; message-matching strings left as they were.
  - logic files changed: src/lib/agreementTerms.js, src/components/chat/mobile/useChatThreadMobile.js, src/lib/razorpay.js
  - screen call groups changed: none

- 2026-10-07T17:07:57.767Z — Session 36. Ravi in chat (7 Oct 2026), answering 'Chat socket ko ek shared connection mein badalna. Isme locked files hain, isliye aapka OK chahiye': 'OK'. Change: open chat thread (ChatBox.jsx desktop, useChatThreadMobile.js mobile) and UGC order screens (BrandUGCOrders.jsx, ManageUGCOrdersView.jsx) use the shared per-tab socket (src/lib/sharedSocket.js acquireSocket) instead of a new io() connection. Same events, same join_room/leave_room/register_user; connect handler -> lease.onConnect (also re-runs after reconnect); disconnect -> lease.release (removes only this screen's listeners). Polling safety net unchanged.
  - logic files changed: src/components/chat/mobile/useChatThreadMobile.js
  - screen call groups changed: none

- 2026-10-07T18:32:38.774Z — Session 36, option A. Ravi in chat (7 Oct 2026): '(A) Sahi tareeka ... continue toh krlo' and earlier 'hn toh fir or locked files ka dhyan se krna' (launch offer / coupons, incl. UGC) + the password-protected '₹0 platform fee + convenience fee' toggle (Zepto-style, shown before signing). Changes, fee lines only: feeCalculator.ts — offer mode (config.offer_mode / offer_fee_pct, default 2%) replaces the rate and coupons, returns feeKind; payment_routes.ts — persistEscrowPayment applies a creator coupon (resolveCreatorCoupon) and records its use; the two payout fallbacks read the fee stamped at payment (stampedFee.feeAtPaymentTime) instead of today's setting; campaign_lifecycle.ts — release uses the stamped fee. Verified by diff; tests backend/feeOfferCoupons.test.ts.
  - logic files changed: backend/campaign_lifecycle.ts, backend/payment_routes.ts, src/utils/feeCalculator.ts
  - screen call groups changed: none

Ravi in chat (8 Oct 2026), answering 'locked files mein sirf animation wali lines badlunga — OK?': 'inke ui mai chnges hone chaiye bas jada kuch nhi khi tum logic vgrh mai chnges kr do baki shuru kro'. UI / motion only in 23 locked screen files: a popup's dark layer and box became PopupBackdrop / PopupPanel (src/components/common/Popup.jsx, same classes, same props, same onClick), `{x && <Popup/>}` wrapped in <Presence> so it can play its closing animation, old per-file initial/animate/exit/spring values replaced by the shared ones in src/lib/motion.js, dead `animate-in fade-in duration-300` removed from page roots, GSAP counter in CreatorUGCOrders.jsx replaced by lib/motion countUp (same ₹ format). No API call, state, handler, text or condition changed; verified by diff.

  - src/components/chat/mobile/ChatBoxMobile.jsx — 4 useMemo hooks moved above `if (!thread) return null` (React "Rendered more hooks" crash when the thread loads). Same code, new position.

  - src/pages/creator/CreatorUGCMobile.jsx — one line `useHideBottomNav(activeView !== "main")` (bottom bar hidden on brief / agreement / workspace, Ravi M13).

  - screen call groups changed: campaign

- 2026-10-09T10:43:23.874Z — Session 41, Ravi (chat): 'locked files ka ok hai but desktop chat flow (campaign, UGC, invite) jaisa hai waisa rehna chahiye'.

- 2026-10-13 — Session 43 v288, Ravi (chat, screenshot of his request "jaise users ke liye delete / complete wipe out ka option h admin ke liye bhi do"): ARCHITECTURE rule 56 changed from "never another admin" to: a full admin may bin or wipe admin / sub-admin accounts; never self; never the last full admin.

Test: backend/adminAccountWipe.test.ts.
- 2026-10-14 — Session 49 v300, Ravi (chat: "unko bhi krke mujhe do vapas but safely" — split the locked files too): locked SCREEN files split into section files, word for word (ChatBox, SystemMessage, MobileCampaignCreate, BrandUGCMobile, CreatorUGCMobile, ManageUGCOrdersView, BrandUGCOrders). Only sections with NO server call / path string were moved, so every screen file makes exactly the same calls as before; no manifest update was needed.

- 2026-10-20T07:15:01.807Z — v355 (20 Oct 2026, Ravi in chat: 'ok h in pr bhi kaam kro'): chatStageMap.js — inbox chips match the chat (contract-ready → Sign contract; funded → creator 'Your turn · upload draft'; declined changes → waiting; own offer → 'Offer sent'; brand who signed → 'Waiting on creator'; creator chip no gross amount). useChatThreadMobile.js — calm error toasts (calmError), accept/counter return false on failure so the Respond sheet stays open.
